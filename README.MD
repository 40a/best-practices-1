# Why?
Many great best practices floating around internet and many of then didn't provide RSS feed so I can't bookmark it via feedly. And even worse some link is manual hosting and wait for it expired then I decide to replicate them here.

# TLDR
It's a backup of best practices I like.

# Backend
- [Best Practices for Building a Microservice Architecture](best-practices-for-building-a-microservice-architecture.md)

# Test
